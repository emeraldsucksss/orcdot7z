All you need is: x32dbg, a version of roblox from 2012 to 2014, corescripts, RBXSigTools, and basic php knowledge

2010+ require websites.

1. Launch x32dbg (not x64dbg) and drag RobloxPlayerBeta.exe into the window

2. Go to Symbols, and double click RobloxPlayerBeta.exe there

3. In the top right corner, there should be a small [Az] Icon. Click on it.

This is the string search window. You don't have to do this multiple times, you can always go back to the References window.




SITE PATCH:
1. Search roblox.com
2. Replace all of the roblox.com links shown. (using the same method as for the Public Key)
3. Control + E to replace!
(There is a check for how long the site name is, try to shoot for a 10 character name)
4!!! READ ME!!!: Do appdata.xml AFTER you do site patch. dont do it before you patch! Or i wil kill you!

IN THE CASE YOUR SITE IS OVER 10 CHARACTERS:

Find the hex length of your site. For example, roblox.com is A, so if my site was roblox2.xyz, it'd be B
Above most of the roblox.com things in the list, is a push then the site length. Change it to the length of your site.

USING EXTREMELY LONG SITES:

If your site is over 12 characters, it might be too long for normal methods to be used. You'll have to do some extra steps.

1. Scroll down to the bottom of the dump, there should be plenty of free space down there.
2. Type your site in. EXAMPLE: thissiteissocool.cf
3. Right click on the first character (in my example its t) and copy the address.
4. Go to the roblox.com, and double click it (not the comment, the push 0x?????)
5. Change push 0x?????? to whatever address is in your clipboard.


blocking %s PATCH:

1. Search blocking %s

2. double click it

3. scroll up a bit, above a few jbs, then a je. change je to jmp




analytics / game PATCH:

1. Search analytics

2. double click the string thats JUST analytics

3. scroll up to find the game string (dont go away from CPU!)

4. change the above jne to a jmp




public key PATCH:

1. search BGIAA

2. You have to generate a key through RBXSigTools. Ask around for it!

3. go to PublicKeyBlob.txt

4. right click the very long string in CPU, and make it the same as the one from PublicKeyBlob.txt




OPTIONAL: invalid request + invalid request 2-5:
This is optional because it poses a security risk. If you are going to do this, it would fit in a launcher revival,
or a small private one. Its basically 2014's trust check.

1. search invalid request

2. in every single one there is a jne or je above it, change it to jmp




OPTIONAL: !isKeyboardAcquired
This makes the windows key work while focused into the window.

1. Search !isKeyboardAcquired

2. Go to the top one (thats just !isKeyboardAcquired)

3. Scroll down a bit, you will see a push 5 (seemingly in the middle of nowhere)

4. Change it to push 6


OPTIONAL (late 2013 / 2014) ReconstructAssetUrl:

this is the same as the site patch but:
Change all robloxlabs.com instances to roblox.com

Create a folder named ClientSettings in the root directory of your roblox folder, and create a ClientAppSettings.json file in there. Inside of that, put this in there.
{"FFlagReconstructAssetUrl": "true"}



EXTRA INFO:

2012 is very janky on how it handles hosting. make sure you use a official host script from the roblox website.

launch args for 2012M-2014 are as follows

PLAYER.exe -t 0 -a 0 -j "http://yoursite.local/path/to/your/join.php?ip=127.0.0.1"

there is no joinscripturl for early 2012 and below, you can use
PLAYER.exe -script "dofile('http://yoursite.local/path/to/your/join.php?ip=127.0.0.1')"
